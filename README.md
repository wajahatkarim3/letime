## :scroll: Description
A minimalist countdown time app inspired by [designs by Richard Ballermann](https://dribbble.com/shots/10242761-Mobile-Check-In-Timer) to demonstrate Jetpack Compose UI for submission in #AndroidDevChallenge Week 2.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I have been experimenting with states and animations to create interesting interactions.
